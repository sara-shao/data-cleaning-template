Problem Statement: The raw data exists in the form of multiple two-way tables, which is difficult to analyze using data visualization software.

Solution: A reusable data cleaning template that would unpivot and combine any number of two-way tables into one table.

Impact: This template saves the company upwards of 5 hours for each dataset that needs to be cleaned, where the larger the dataset, the more time is saved.
