When I was at my last internship, I was chatting with another intern in the break room and I asked him what he was currently working on. He said he was doing some data cleaning to turn the raw sales data he was working with into a different form so he could make his data report. I asked if I could take a look and he showed me the data and explained the objective: there were separate tables for categories like sales, sales target, budget, etc. where in each two-way table the columns were the months and the rows were the markets. He needed to combine all these separate tables into one table that had the columns Market, Date, Sales, Sales Target, etc. The way he was going about this was by doing Vlookups a couple rows at a time, one column at a time. It was going to take him probably a week. I made him this reusable Jupyter Notebook template in an hour that outputs the desired data in seconds, and with a little walkthrough he could use it on other datasets that he needed to processed in the same fashion. So, although the purpose of the code is rather simple, it's incredible practical, user-friendly, and automates a previously time-consuming and tedious process.
