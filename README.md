Problem Statement: The raw data exists in the form of multiple two-way tables, which is difficult to analyze using data visualization software.

Solution: I made a reusable data cleaning template that would unpivot and combine any number of two-way tables into one table.

Impact: Having this template saves anywhere from 5-10 hours of company time for each dataset that needs to be cleaned, depending on the size of the dataset.
